# COMP3512 - Assignment 2
## 

### Overview
This assignment is a group project that expands your first assignment in functionality and scope. It is
broken into several milestones with different dates. The milestones are in place to ensure your group is
progressing appropriately.
Some of the specific details for some of the milestones and pages will develop over time; that is, this
assignment specification is a living document that will grow over the next several weeks.

### Composition
You can work in groups of three or four for this assignment. It is also possible to work individually or in a
pair, but I do discourage it; please talk to me about this if you are planning on working by yourself or as
a pair.

If working in a group, each member needs to take responsibility for and complete an appropriate
amount of the project work. Be sure to consult the instructor at least one week prior to any due date if
your group is experiencing serious problems in this regard.
I feel foolish saying this in a third-year university course, but it is your responsibility to read all the
assignment instructions thoroughly and carefully. If you are unclear about something, ask me. But
before you do, read the material in question again!
